"# TabSaver" 

 This is a chrome extension that allows the user to collect all the open tabs as a list to save RAM usage. 
 I know other similar extensions like this exist but I was concerned about their privacy and a lot of them seem to have frills.
 So I made one that was as readable and as lightweight as I felt I could get away with so even a user unfamiliar with programming could be sure no shenanigans are going on.
